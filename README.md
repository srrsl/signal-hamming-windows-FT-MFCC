# signal-hamming-windows-FT-MFCC

First of all we need to have preprocess before take any action in Audio signal process which they are as follow :

1- fourier transform which is used in spectroscopy, to analyze peaks, and troughs.
2- Mel frequency coefficients(MFCC) for feature extraction
3- windowing (framing) which we used hamming window in this sample
